# HaakonsVikinger
Norway (Northern Fronts) WW2 Antistasi

Haakon's Vikinger (or Haakon's Vikings) is a modification of Antistasi, namely the Polish WW2 Antistasi scenario.

1944, it's been almost four years since King Haakon and his Government was forced to flee Norway. With horrible events in recent memory, like the Telavåg tradegy, the population of Svartmarka has been getting restless. Remnants of the Norwegian army and civilians who were tired with the Nazi occupation have been operating in Milorg since the start of the war, but with Germany's recent major setbacks, it's time to do more than disrupt and sabotage; it's time to deal a significant blow to the Reich.

Through Milorg's association with the Government in exile, over in London, Haakon's Vikinger: a group of the old Norwegian Army local to Svartmarka has managed to make contact with allied forces and British Army commandos. These forces have promised to provide supplies and intelligence to supplement Haakon's Vikinger's dwindling supply of Norwegian weapons and uniforms.

Their first tip? A stockpile of rifles that were taken from surrendered Norwegian forces are being held nearby in the town of Lakselv. Gather up whatever rifle or shotgun your grandfather has hung up on the wall and prepare to move!

---------------

If you don't want to fight the Soviets, you can change the gamemode in parameters. Fighting the Soviets is still set as the default because it sounds more fun.

Please still include this addon on the server as it has a file defining some key units & giving task force radio compatibility to Faces of War

Disclaimer:
This was created specifically for a group of friends who wanted to have the antistasi experience, but with a Norwegian take. By extension of this, it is only tested with ALL of the mods that are marked as dependent, but it would probably still run with only half of them. I am also not an experienced ArmA developer, just someone who knows their way around computers who wanted to do Norway WW2 rather than Poland WW2.
This means:
Some things are configured in a way I want them to be, rather than the ideal/accurate way. I don't mind at all if you take this addon and change it around how you want & publish it just make sure to credit the antistasi team
